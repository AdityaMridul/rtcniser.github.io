<h3 style="font-size: 35px; color: darkgoldenrod; font-family: MyCustomFont; font-weight: bolder;">RoboTech Club, NISER</h3>
<center><p style="font-weight: 600px;">This student-run club was established in 2015, along the lines of similar clubs in the IITs and various engineering colleges. In 2019, we started functioning under Dr. Subhankar Mishra’s Lab in the School of Computer Sciences, NISER and we work with cutting edge robotic technologies,  equipment and  modern tools such as 3D Printers, various micro-controllers, machining toolkits and numerous other instruments</p></center>
<p style="font-weight: 600px;">Initially set up as a means to serve the hobbies of a group of robotics enthusiasts, the club has grown into a much bigger endeavor with numerous achievements, producing highly skilled alumni. We seek to provide the students of NISER with the opportunity to turn their novel ideas into reality. Most of our current projects are direct products of the handwork of such innovative students. We have worked on several fun and useful projects, listed in the projects page. We also love to do competitive robotics and participate in various Robotics Competitions, held around the country. We have a number of projects dedicated to those competitions. We have also collaborated with different clubs and departments of NISER in our ventures.</p>
<br>
<span class="adminheading">Joining the Club:</span>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Each academic year, the RoboTech Club seeks passionate individuals who are eager to contribute to our ambitious projects. While prior technical skills are not mandatory (coding, for example, isn't always our top priority), new members are expected to quickly develop the technical, social, and management skills necessary for the smooth operation of the club. 
<br>
<br>
Membership is open to students from NISER who can commit at least 2-3 years to the club, ensuring long-term collaboration and contribution to our goals. To maintain a strong sense of community and ensure the efficient functioning of the club, we limit the number of members. However, we are always open to engaging with people outside the club for discussions, collaborations, and idea-sharing.

<i>If you're a 1st year Msc. student of NISER, please don't hesitate to reach us out through an email. You'll probably get a place in our sessions in Skill Development.</i>
