<h2> Our Vision: </h2>

<hr style="color: darkgoldenrod">
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>This club was set up as a means to serve the hobbies of a group of robotics enthusiasts. The club has grown into a much bigger endeavour, with more than 25 dynamic members. We develop ambitious robotics projects, host national-level events , and actively engage in disseminating technical knowledge to our fellow NISERites!</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">We seek to provide the students of NISER with the opportunity to turn their novel ideas into reality. As a community, we empower each other with skills and knowledge about present day technology such as Development Boards, Machine Learning & Image Processing, IOT, 3D Modelling & Printing, Simulations, etc. We are currently working on a one year schedule for all club members with the hopes of enabling everyone with the required knowledge of using technology in most efficient way for functioning in various feats of our academic and professional career.</p>
